Rotate.js is a small library to detect device orientation inspired by 
shake.js (https://github.com/alexgibson/shake.js). It is using the 
DeviceOrientation Event as descriped in the W3C craft
http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation and tries to 
compensate for different browser implementation.
Please note that this specification is still in flux and may be changed.

Testet for:
- chrome mobile
- firefox mobile
